NAME
    RT::Condition::NotStartedInBusinessHours - Check for unstarted tickets
    within business hours

DESCRIPTION
    This RT condition will check for tickets which are not started within
    business hours.

SYNOPSIS
  CLI
        rt-crontool
            --search RT::Search::ModuleName
            --search-arg 'The Search Argument'
            --condition RT::Condition::NotStartedInBusinessHours
            --condition-arg 'The Condition Argument'
            --action RT::Action:ActionModule
            --template 'Template Name or ID'

INSTALLATION
    This condition based on the following modules:

        RT >= 4.0.0
        Date::Manip >= 6.34

    To install this condition run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    or place this script under

        $RT_HOME/local/lib/RT/Condition/

    where $RT_HOME is the path to your RT installation, for example
    "/opt/rt4".

    You may additionally make this condition available in RT's web UI as a
    Scrip Condition:

        make initdb

    Another way to install the latest release is via CPAN:

        cpan RT::Condition::NotStartedInBusinessHours
        $RT_HOME/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert --datafile /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Condition-NotStartedInBusinessHours/etc/initialdata

    The second command is equivalent to "make initdb", but is unfortunately
    not executed automatically.

CONFIGURATION
  RT SITE CONFIGURATION
    To enabled this condition edit the RT site configuration located under
    "$RT_HOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm":

        Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::Condition::NotStartedInBusinessHours));

    To change the standard behavior of Date::Manip you may add to the site
    configuration:

        Set(%DateManipConfig, (
            'WorkDayBeg', '9:00',
            'WorkDayEnd', '17:00', 
            #'WorkDay24Hr', '0',
            'WorkWeekBeg', '1',
            'WorkWeekEnd', '5'
        ));

  CONDITION ARGUMENT
    This condition needs exactly 1 argument to work.

        --condition RT::Condition::NotStartedInBusinessHours 
        --condition-arg 1

    1 is the time in hours for escalation.

  EXAMPLE CRON JOB
        rt-crontool 
            --search RT::Search::FromSQL 
            --search-arg "Queue = 'General' AND ( Status = 'new' ) AND Owner = 'Nobody'" 
            --condition RT::Condition::NotStartedInBusinessHours 
            --condition-arg 1 
            --action RT::Action::RecordComment 
            --template 'Unowned tickets'
